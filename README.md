# program to create a Sequential Stream from an Iterator



Iterators, in Java, are used in Collection Framework to retrieve elements one by one.

A stream in Java is a pipeline of objects from an array or a collection data source. A sequential stream is one in which the objects are pipelined in a single stream on the same processing system. Other types of stream include Parallel stream in which the objects are pipelined on multi-processing system.
